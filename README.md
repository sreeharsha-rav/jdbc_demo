## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- MySQL database server installed and running
- MySQL Connector/J library added to your project

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
3. Update the database connection details in the `MyConnection.Java` file.
4. Run the `Main.java` file to execute the demo.

## Functionality

    ```xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>mysql</groupId>
            <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
            <version>8.0.23</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```
2. Copy the `MyConnection.java` file to your project.
3. Update the database connection details in the `MyConnection.java` file.
4. Implement the necessary CRUD operations for your entity.
